***A new way to sort array by using a simple Algorithm of comparison.***

**DESCRIPTION**

That's a program that create an arraay with some special value
They are given by the user. After that, we have to sort this array with
a particuliar method. 
We compare the first element of the array with the element at the place 
array[i], and if this one is less than the first element, we exchange their
place. 

With this algorithm, the small element of the array is at the first place and 
the more bigger is at the last.
