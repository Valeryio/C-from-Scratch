## EXERCICE 4

### PRINCIPAL Lesson Learned :

***I've learned that pointers are very easy to use if you take care of 
what you are doing with. I've created an array of pointers that points towards 
strings... 
And I made some manipulation on that data structure. That was very 
fun, and I learned a lot of things that I cannot dump here. But, trust me, it was fun.***

**My programs don't actually free the memory after using pointers, but I'll learn it in 
the following days!** ('-')

### DESCRIPTION

In this program, I've wrote an algorithm to implement a language that is in reality an array of string
on which I can perform some operations. Remove, show, add, gather...
That's very useful, and I think That I'll complete this library in the future to make something pretty
comprehensive!
