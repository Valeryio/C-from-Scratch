## EXERCICE 5

### PRINCIPAL Lesson Learned :

***I've learned that funtions that are declared like thing :***

`int main(int argc, char* argv[])`

***are very well thought. By declaring a function with an array of string, these one can take 
argument from the command line, directly. If the name of your program is my_prog, you have something like this***

`commande_line-> my_prog one, two `

***The program will take the string one, and two like element of the array of strings (like arguments).
Now, in that case you don't give any argument to the function, it will use its own name. This kind of 
declaration helps the program to know its own name, and reduce the number of error.***

### DESCRIPTION

In this program, I've wrote an algorithm to know more about a kind of declarations we often use in C programming.
