## EXERCICE 5

### PRINCIPAL Lesson Learned :

***That's a new repo, and the thing I really learned is that, we always think we
already knew enough, till we face a big problem that we cannot solve without working hard.
That makes few days I'm working on this project, and I learn some cool things.
**Using pointers is be careful, so it's important to free the memory after you use it!** ('-')

### DESCRIPTION

In this program, I've wrote some algorithms to work on... array of strings (Once Again !)
But this time, I learned that malloc (memory allocation), calloc (clear allocate) and realloc (reallocation)
are used to allocate the memory. scanf() is limited by the space character ' ', so it's important to use another
funtion, like fgets(), to take strings with sentences.
A pointer is a variable that have a place in the memory, and have a size of 4 bytes on 32-bytes arch, and 8 bytes
on 64--bytes arch.

**YOU CAN CREATE AN ARRAY OF POINTERS THAT POINTS TO STRINGS WITHOUT GIVE THEM AN ADDRESS, BUT YOU SHOULD INITIALISE THEM TO NULL**
That's more clean and clear !
