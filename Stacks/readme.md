# Stacks

Staks are datastructures concept based on the LIFO algorithm. So the last element that get in
is the first that get out! Last In First Out

Let's implement the simple operations on this datastructure concept that we can use to perform
operations : 

## isEmpy
Most of time, we need to verify if a stack is empty or not, before performing operations, so
very clean to write the code for this function to avoid repetition.

## createNode
All the magic of stacks is about creating and updating nodes along a chain of elements, so,
it's a clean idea to write the code for this function too.

## push
We have to add new elements to a stack, it's a common operation, so we have to write a function
for it. And to add an element to the stack, the have to add it at the top of the stack.

## pop
If we want to delete an element, we have to pop it from the top of the stack, following the rules
as the concept of stack are built.

## pall
Pall is an instruction of monty code. It can be used to print all the value of a stack.

## pint
Pint is an instruction of monty code. It can be used to print the value at the top of the stack
followed by a new line.

## swap
