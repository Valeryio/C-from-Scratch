## EXERCICE 8

### PRINCIPAL Lesson Learned :

**A - L - R - I - G - H - T**
**WRITE THE ALGORITHM BEFORE START CODING - ALWAYS!**

### DESCRIPTION

***I wrote an algorithm to cipher a file and copy the cipher in another file. ***
**I've used the same function that I wrote in the last repo, but I spent time on 
some bugs.**

### WHAT I LEARNED

**Feel free to use pointers, but, ALWAYS ALLOCATE THE NECESSERAY MEMORY, to manipulate
them fluently.

And, some function like scanf could really have an undetermined unexpected results, so
be focus when you're writing code!**

**THAT'S ALL**

> If there's something you want to do, just do it, don't let you head stop your heart from moving...
