## EXERCICE 9

### PRINCIPAL Lesson Learned :

**New Repo !

It's just a letter's frequency counter**


### DESCRIPTION

**The first thing I learned here is that : when you have a pointer on an array of data structure, you can just write array[i].item, don't need to use the arrow array[i]->item
You can do that for a simple var of the data structure, but for an array, it's not necessary!**

**Then, when you create a data structure that you should use in a lot of file, you should create it in a separate header file and call it in all the file in which you need it.**

**YOU CAN CREATE AN ARRAY OF POINTERS THAT POINTS TO A DATA STRUCTURE WITHOUT GIVE THEM AN ADDRESS, BUT YOU SHOULD INITIALISE THEM TO NULL**
That's more clean and clear !

> If there's something you wanna do, just DO IT. Don't let your HEAD stop your HEART from moving...
